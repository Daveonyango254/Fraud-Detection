# Fraudulent Transaction Classification
This repository contains the implementation of three classification machine learning algorithms: Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression. The goal is to classify fraudulent transactions using transaction data from Kaggle.

# Features
Decision Tree: A tree-based model to classify transactions.
Naive Bayes: A probabilistic model based on Bayes' theorem.
Logistic Regression: A statistical model for binary classification.

# Dataset
Source: Kaggle transaction data
Description: The dataset includes various features of transactions used to identify fraudulent activities.
